A web app that gives you weather report of any place at any time based on the name/coordinates provided by the user. The app also 
provides air pollution data and weather forecast up to 5 days for any searched place. Many interactive tools such as the UNSPLASH API for rendering images, MAPTILER for displaying maps are integrated in the app to make your weather surfing experience good. A new feature I recently added where you can search for severe weather alerts as well for a location and the map displayed will have markers on all the affected areas according to the report.
