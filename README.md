A web app that gives you weather report of any place at any time based on the name/coordinates provided by the user. The app also 
provides air pollution data and weather forecast up to 5 days for any searched place. Many interactive tools such as CLOUDINARY for 
storing images, MAPTILER for displaying maps are integrated in the app to make your weather surfing experience good. A new feature I recently added where you can search for severe weather alerts as well for a location and the map displayed will have markers on all the affected areas according to the report.
